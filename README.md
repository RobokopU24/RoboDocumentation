# RoboDocumentation

A collection of notebooks and other documents to help users get the most out of ROBOKOP.

For users who are new to ROBOKOP and would like to incorporate calls to ROBOKOP in their Python scripts, go to the Documentation directory for the `HelloRobokop` notebook series.  It is recommended to go through the notebooks in the order below:
	1. HelloRobokop.ipynb
	2. HelloRobokop_TRAPI.ipynb
	3. HelloRobokop_TRAPI_multiple_IDs.ipynb
	4. HelloRobokop_Cypher.ipynb
	5. HelloRobokop_ExEmPLAR.ipynb
	6. HelloRobokop_Compare.ipynb

Currently, the Testing directory is the section for developers and may at a later date contain test cases using ROBOKOP.
